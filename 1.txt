With the developing of modern society, social cognition about extended family is varying rapidly. Some believe that the extended family is less important now than it was in the past and some people disagree with this. On balance, my favor goes on the former. I do think that the extended family is less important now than it was. 

In modern society, the relationship between extended family members is not so close than it was in the past. There are several reasons. For one thing, developing of transportation technology makes family members separating from each other geographical possible. That means maintaining a solid bond between extended family members is becoming more and more difficult. Take myself for example, my aunt and my father live in different cities so that father and I can not always see my aunt  face to face. Because of this, we can not be as close as past. The only chance to communicate face to face in a year is having annual Spring Festival dinner.

And for another, maintaining solid relationships between extended family members has become not only improbable but unnecessary as well. Nowadays people are becoming freer and more independent. We are individuals rather than members of family, which means we can still live our life without extended family. In the past, the extended family had the responsibility to bring you wealth, renown, prestige and chance. However, modern life redefined the word "family". The modern family is not an approach to wonderful life. The crucial factor of your life is yourself. Relationships between extended family members are not as special as it was any more. It is more like a friendship inborn and we do not have to make every friendship intimately.

No one can deny the extended family relationship is significant in the past, but as we see, maintaining this sort of relationship has become improbable and unnecessary nowadays. So for my perspective, the extended family does become less important now than it was in the past.
